  <h2 class='c004'>“HOW MAMA USED TO PLAY.”</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'><i><span class='small'>There was once a very happy little girl who spent her childhood on an old green farm.
She had a little sister, and these two children never knew what it was to possess toys from
the stores, but played, played, played from dawn till dark, just in the play-places they found
on that green farmstead. I so often have to tell my children “how mama used to play”—for
I was that very happy little girl—that I think other “little women” of these days will
enjoy knowing about those dear old simple play-times.</span></i></p>

<h3 class='c006'>I.—THE LITTLE STUMP-HOUSE.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>One of my pet playhouses was an old stump, out in the pasture.
Such a dear, old stump as it was, and so large I could not put
my arms more than half way round it!</p>

<p class='c008'>Some of its roots were partly bare of earth for quite a little distance
from the stump, and between these roots were great green
velvety moss cushions.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the side, above the largest moss cushion, was a little shelf where
a bit of the stump had fallen away. On this little shelf I used to
place a little old brass candlestick. I used to play that that part of
the stump was my parlor.</p>

<p class='c008'>Above the next moss cushion were a number of shelves where I laid
pieces of dark-blue broken china I had found and washed clean in the
brook. That was my dining-room.</p>

<p class='c008'>There were two or three little bedrooms where the puffy moss beds
were as soft as down. My rag dolly had many a nap on those little
green beds, all warmly covered up with big sweet-smelling ferns.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then there was the kitchen! Hardly any moss grew there. I
brought little white pebbles from the brook, and made a pretty, white
floor. Into the side of the stump above this shining floor, I drove a
large nail. On this nail hung the little tin pan and iron spoon with
which I used to mix up my mud pies.</p>

<p class='c008'>My sister had a stump much like mine, and such fine times as the
owners of those two little stump-houses used to have together, only
little children know anything about.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>Two little girls went shopping with their mamma. While she
was at the end of the store, Julie, the youngest, ran to the door.
Her mother was too busy to notice her, but Julie’s sister Mattie was
watching her. She saw
a tall woman pass the
door, and snatch up little
Julie. Without a word
to her mother, Mattie ran
after them.</p>

too. They came
up with the woman as she
was darting into a cellar. Mattie told the policeman that the bad
woman had stolen her sister Julie. He soon took both children
home. Their mother was overjoyed to see them, and praised Mattie
for being such a brave little girl. She never let Julie go out of her

</div>
<h3 class='c006'>II.-THE OLD APPLE-TREE.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>There was an old apple-tree in the orchard that was the oldest
tree in the town. It overtopped the house, and the trunk was
very big and brown and rough; but O, the millions of fine green leaves,
as soft and smooth as silk, that it held up in the summer air!</p>

<p class='c008'>In the spring it was gay with pink and white blossoms, and then
for days the tree would be all alive with the great, black-belted bees.
A little later those sweet blossoms would fall off in a rosy rain, and
Myra and I would stand under the old apple-tree and try to catch the
little, fluttering things in our apron! And then, later still, came little
apples, very sour at first, but slowly sweetening until it seemed to me
that those juicy, golden-green apples tasted the best of any fruit in all
the world! My apron-pockets were always bursting with them!</p>

<p class='c008'>There was a famous horse up in the old tree. It could only be
reached by means of a ladder placed against the old tree’s stout trunk!
A strange horse, you would call him, but O, the famous rides that I
have had on that horse’s broad, brown back! The name of the horse
was “General.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Up among the leaves where the sunshine played hide-and-seek was
one dear bough that was just broad enough and just crooked enough
to form a nice seat. Another bough bent round just in the very place
to form a most comfortable back to that seat. A pair of stirrups made
of rope, some rope reins tied to the trunk of the tree, and there was
my horse, “all saddled and all bridled!”</p>

<p class='c008'>I put my feet into the stirrups, shake my bridle-reins and cry,
“Get up, General!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The bough would sway a little, and I and the birds would be off
together, swinging and singing, up in a fair green world where there
was no one to disturb nest or little rider! The birds would sing to me,
and I would sing to them, and which of those little singers was the
happiest, I do not know!</p>

<p class='c008'>But I do know that my little heart was full of glee and joy to the
brim!</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>SHE WISHED TO BE A PRINCESS.<br /> <span class='large'><i>A True Story.</i></span></h2>
</div>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>Little Mary had had a volume of Hans Andersen’s Fairy Stories
given her at Christmas. The story she liked best was “The
Princess and the Pea,” for, like all little girls, little Mary had a natural
desire to be a Princess.</p>

<p class='c008'>When she went to bed at night with her doll little Mary would
think to herself, “Oh, how beautiful to be a real princess of such very
fine blood as to feel a little bit of a pea under twenty mattresses!”</p>

<p class='c008'>One morning a comforting idea came to little Mary. “Who
knows,” she said to herself, “with all my very many great grandfathers
and grandmothers, but p’raps I am related to some King or
Queen way back?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Thereupon, she went to her mother’s pantry and took a bean from
the jar—as large a one as she could find—and, going to her room,
put it carefully under the hair mattress. That night she went to bed
happy, with joyful hopes.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the morning little Mary’s elder sister found her with her head
buried in her pillow crying. “Oh,” little Mary sobbed, “I did think
I might have just a little speck of royal blood in my veins, but I
couldn’t feel even that big bean under just one mattress!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Nothing would comfort little Mary until her mama explained to
her that even princesses were not happy unless they had good hearts;
and <i>she</i> could have, if she tried, just as good and royal a heart as any
Princess under the sun.</p>

</div>
<h3 class='c006'>III.—THE LITTLE POND.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>Out in the pasture, was a little pond. This little pond was quite
deep in the time of the spring and autumn rains. At such
seasons Myra and I would take our little raft made of boards, and by
means of some stout sticks would push the raft around on that little
pond for hours. The wind would raise little waves, and these waves
would splash up against the sides of our little raft with a delicious sort
of noise.</p>

<p class='c008'>We used to dress a smooth stick of wood in doll’s clothes. We
used to call this wooden dolly by the name of Mrs. Pippy. We would
take Mrs. Pippy on board our ship as passenger. Somehow, Mrs.
Pippy always contrived to fall overboard. And then, such screaming,
such frantic pushing of that raft as there would he, before that calmly-floating
Mrs. Pippy was rescued!</p>

<p class='c008'>Just beyond the further edge of the pond was a little swampy
place where great clumps of sweet-flag used to grow. Sweet-flag is a
water-plant whose leaves are very long and slender and their stem-ends,
where they wrap about each other, are good to eat. In summer
this little sweet-flag swamp was perfectly dry. But when the rains
had come and the little pond was full, this little sweet-flag swamp was
covered with water.</p>

<p class='c008'>Right between the pond and the swamp lay a big timber, stretching
away like a narrow bridge, with the pond-water lapping it on one
side and the swamp-water lapping it on the other. Such exciting times
as we used to have running across that little bridge after sweet-flag!</p>

<p class='c008'>“Run! run!” we would cry to each other; and then, away we
would go, running like the wind, yet very carefully, for the least misstep
was sure to plump us into the water!</p>

<p class='c008'>When the water in the swamp had nearly dried up, a bed of the
very nicest kind of mud was left. Taking off our shoes and stockings,
we would dance in that sticky mud until we were tired. Then we
would hop over the timber and wash our small toes clean in the pond.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>“You like clever cats, Arthur,”

know this cat, mamma?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, my dear, I was
staying at the house when
his mistress found him out.
We used to wonder sometimes
why there was so little
milk for tea, and my
friend would say ‘They
must drink it in the kitchen,
for the neck of the milk
jug is so narrow, Tom could
not get his great head in.’</p>

<p class='c008'>“But Tom was too clever
to be troubled at the narrow
neck of the milk or cream
jug, and one day when his
mistress was coming towards the parlor through the garden, she saw Tom
on the table from the window, dipping his paw into the jug like a spoon
and carrying the milk to his mouth. Did he not jump down quickly, and
hide himself when she walked in, for he well knew he was doing wrong.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And was he punished, mamma?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, Laura, although his mistress scolded him well, and Tom quite
understood, for cats who are kindly treated are afraid of angry words.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Did you ever see Tom drink the milk in this way?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, for his mistress was proud of his cleverness, and she would
place the jug on the floor for him. When she did that, Tom knew he
might drink it, and he would take up the milk in his paw so cleverly
that it was soon gone.”</p>

</div>
<h3 class='c006'>IV.—THE LITTLE BROOK.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>We had a merry playmate in a little brook that ran down through
the sunny meadows! It slipped and slid over little mossy
pebbles and called to us, “Follow, follow, follow!” in the sweetest
little voice in the world!</p>

<p class='c008'>Sometimes, I would kneel down on the little low bank, and bend my
head down close, and ask, “Where are you going, little brook?”</p>

<p class='c008'>It would splash a cool drop of spray in my face, and run on calling,
“Follow, follow, follow!” just as before.</p>

<p class='c008'>Wild strawberries grew red and sweet down in the tall grass, and
great purple violets, and tall buttercups nid-nodding in the wind.</p>

<p class='c008'>Very often Myra and I would take off our shoes and stockings, and
wade. The roguish little brook would tickle my small toes, and try and
trip me up on one of its little mossy stones. Once I did slip and sat
right down in the water with a great splash! And the little brook
took all the starch out of my clothes, and ran off with it in a twinkling.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now and then, I would fasten a bent pin to a string and tie the
string to the end of a stick and fish for the tiny minnows and tadpoles.
But, somehow, I never caught one of the little darting things. I used
to believe the brook whispered them to keep away from that little
shining hook.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sometimes, I would take a big white chip and load it with pebbles
or violets and send it down stream. The sly little brook would slip my
boat over one of its tiny waterfalls just as quick as it could! If my
little boat was loaded with pebbles, down would go my heavy cargo to
the bottom! But if it were loaded with violets, then a fleet of fairy
purple canoes would float on and on, and away out of sight.</p>

<p class='c008'>A great green frog with big, staring eyes watched from the side of
the brook. Now and then, he would say, “Ker-chug!” in a deep voice.
I used to ask him in good faith, what “ker-chug!” meant. But he
did not tell, and to this day I have not found out what “ker-chug”
means.</p>

</div>
<h3 class='c006'>V.—THE MEADOW-ROCKS.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>Another place where I played was out on the meadow-rocks.
Right down in a level spot in the meadow were three great
rocks. Each one of these rocks was as large as a dining-room table.
Right through this little flat place ran the brook I have told you about,
bubbling round our three great rocks.</p>

<p class='c008'>0, what splendid playhouses those rocks were! We each owned
one. The third was owned by that wooden doll, Mrs. Pippy. In order
to get to either one of the houses you had to cross a little bridge that
spanned a tiny river. Also there were dear little steps up the sides of
the rocks which it was such a pleasure to go up and down.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the top of the rocks, which were almost as flat as the top of a
table, were little closely-clinging patches of moss that we called our
rugs. There were queer-shaped hollows in the tops of these rocks.
In one little moss-lined hollow I used to cradle my baby-doll. Another
hollow was my kitchen sink. I used to fill up my sink with bits of
broken dishes, turn on some water from the brook, and then such a
scrubbing as my dishes got!</p>

<p class='c008'>At the rocks, kneeling down on the planks that formed our bridges,
we used to wash our dollies’ clothes. Then we would spread them on
the grass to dry. Didn’t we use to keep our babies clean and sweet!</p>

<p class='c008'>Afterwards, pinning our short skirts up about us, we would wash
the floors of our little rock houses until they shone. When everything
was spick-and-span, we would unpin our skirts, pull down our
sleeves, rub our rosy cheeks with a mullein leaf to make them rosier,
and with a big burdock leaf tied on with a couple of strings for a bonnet
we would go calling on our lazy neighbor, Mrs. Pippy, and give
her a serious “talking-to.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Or, perhaps, we would call on each other and talk about the terrible
illnesses our poor children were suffering from. Or, perhaps, we
would go to market. The market consisted of a long row of raspberry
bushes along the meadow fence.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'><i>THE SNOW WITCH.</i></h2>
</div>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>There was skating on the ponds where the snow had been cleared;
there were icicles on the trees, nice blue, clear skies in the daytime,
cold, bright, wintry moonlight at night.</p>

<p class='c008'>Lovely weather for Christmas holidays! But to one little five-year-old
man, nothing had seemed lovely this Christmas, though he was spending
it with his Father and Mother and his big sisters at Grandpapa’s
beautiful old country house, where everybody did all that could be done
to make Grandpapa’s guests happy. For poor little Roger was pining for
his elder brother, Lawson, whom he had not seen for more than four
months. Lawson was eight, and had been at school since Michaelmas,
and there he had caught a fever which had made it not safe for him to join
the rest of the family till the middle of January. But he was coming
to-morrow.</p>

<p class='c008'>Why, then, did Roger still look sad and gloomy?</p>

<p class='c008'>“Stupid little boy!” said Mabel. “I’m sure we’ve tried to amuse
him. Why, Mamma let him sit up an hour later than usual last night,
to hear all those funny old fairy tales and legends Uncle Bob was
telling.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, and weren’t they fun?” answered Pansy. “I did shiver at
the witch ones, though, didn’t you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Poor little Roger! Pansy’s shivering was nothing to his! They had
all walked home from the vicarage, tempted by the clear, frosty moonlight
and the hard, dry ground; and trotting along, a little behind the others, a
strange thing had happened to the boy. Fancy—in the field by the Primrose
Lane, through the gateway, right in a bright band of moonlight, <i>he
had seen a witch</i>. Just such a witch as Uncle Bob had described—with
shadowy garments, and outstretched arms, and a queer-shaped head, on all
of which the icicles were sparkling,
just as Uncle Bob had said.
For it was a winter-witch he had
told the story about, whose dwelling
was up in the frozen northern
seas—“the Snow Witch” they
called her.</p>

<div  class='figleft id014'>
<img src='images/illus023.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'>Cold as it was, Roger was
in a bath of heat, his heart beating
wildly, his legs shaking, when he
overtook his sisters. And the
night that followed was full of
terrible dreams and starts and
misery, even though nurse and baby were next door, and he could see
the night-light through the chinks. If it had not been that Lawson was
coming—Lawson who never laughed at him or called him “stupid little
goose,” Lawson who listened to all his griefs—Roger could not have
borne it. For, strange to say, the little fellow told no one of his trouble;
he felt as if he could <i>only</i> tell Lawson.</p>

<p class='c008'>No wonder he looked pale and sad and spiritless; there was still
another dreadful night to get through before Lawson came.</p>

<p class='c008'>But things sometimes turn out better than our fears. Late that
afternoon, when nursery tea was over and bedtime not far off, there came
the sound of wheels and then a joyful hubbub. Lawson had come! Uncle
Bob had been passing near the school where he was, and had gone a little
out of his way to pick him up. Every one was delighted—oh, of them all,
<i>none</i> so thankful as Roger.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Though I wont tell him to-night,” decided the unselfish little
fellow, “not to spoil his first night. I sha’n’t mind when I know he’s in
his cot beside me.” And even when Lawson lovingly asked him if anything
was the matter, he kept to his resolution.</p>

<p class='c008'>But he woke in the middle of the night from a terrible dream;
Lawson woke too, and then—out it all came.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I thought she was coming in at the window,” Roger ended. “If—if
you look out—it’s moonlight—I think <i>p’r’aps</i> you’ll see where she stands.
But no, no! Don’t, <i>don’t</i>! She might see you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>So Lawson agreed to wait till to-morrow.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I have an idea,” said Lawson. “Roger, darling, go to sleep. <i>I’m</i>
here, and you can say your prayers again if you like.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Lawson was up very early next morning. And as soon as breakfast
was over he told Roger to come out with him. Down the Primrose Lane
they went, in spite of Roger’s trembling.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now, shut your eyes,” said Lawson, when they got to the gate.
He opened it, and led his brother through.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Look, now!” he said, with a merry laugh. And what do you
think Roger saw?</p>

<div  class='figright id015'>
<img src='images/illus024.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'>An old scarecrow, forgotten since last year. There she stood, the
“Snow Witch,” an apron and ragged
shawl, two sticks for arms, a bit of
Grandpapa’s hat, to crown all—that
was the witch!</p>

<p class='c008'>“Shake hands with her,
Roger,” said Lawson. And shake
hands they both did, till the old

  <h2 class='c004'><i>THE THREE BLIND MICE.</i><br /> <span class='large'><i>THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE.</i></span></h2>
</div>

<div class='c005'>
  <img class='drop-capi' src='images/illus025.jpg' width='300' alt='' />
</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
Well, first of all, I must tell you that I am a
Brownie, and although I am ever and ever so
old, I look as young to-day as I did when
I was but one year old. Well, it was about
seven hundred years ago, and I used to be a
great deal with some other Brownies, cousins of mine, visiting
at the same farm-houses as they did, and helping them
with their work. And it was in this way that I got to know
the Three Blind Mice,—Purrin, Furrin, and Tod.</p>

<p class='c008'>Pretty, pleasant little fellows they were; and they
were not blind then,—far from it. They lived up in the loft of Dame
Marjoram’s room, over at Fiveoaks Farm.</p>

<p class='c008'>Such merry supper-parties as never were, I think, before or since, we
used to have then. We would think nothing of finishing a round of apple
and a walnut-shell full of honey between us, in one evening, to say nothing
of scraps of cheese-rind and the crumbs we stole from the birds. Purrin
had a most melodious voice, and could sing a good song, while Tod was
never at a loss for an amusing story. As to Furrin, he was almost as quaint
as our Mr. Puck, and, though perhaps it is not for <i>me</i> to say so, when those
in high places do encourage him, not one-tenth as mischievous.</p>

<p class='c008'>When Angelina, the old stable cat, had kittens, he would get into all
sorts of out-of-the-way places, and imitate their squeaky little voices, so that
she was always on the fidget, thinking she must have mislaid one somewhere,
and never able to find it. For you see, as she could not count, she
never knew whether they were all beside her or no. Often he would coax
a whole hazel-nut out of Rudge, the Squirrel, who lived on the Hanger, just
above, and whom every one believed to be a miser. And then his Toasting-fork
Dance was so sprightly and graceful, it did your heart good to see
it. Ah, me! those days are gone, and Furrin is gone too; and the Moon,
when she looks through that chink in the barn roof, no longer sees us
feasting and making merry on the great beam.</p>

<p class='c008'>And this is how they became blind:</p>

<div  class='figright id016'>
<img src='images/illus026.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'>They were very fond of Gilliflower, Dame Marjoram’s little daughter,
and after the nurse had put her to bed, Furrin, Purrin, and Tod used to
creep up into her room, and read her some of the funny
little tales from Mouse-land till she went to sleep. She
would lie there with her eyes shut, and perhaps imagined
that it was her own thoughts that made her fancy
all about the fairy tales that came into her head; but
really it was the mice who read them to her, but in such
a low voice that Gilliflower never thought of opening
her eyes to see if any one was there. I must tell you
that the print in Mouse-land is <span class='xxsmall'>very, very small</span> and hard to
read. This did not matter so much during the long
Summer evenings, when there was plenty of light to
see to read by; but when the Winter came on, and the mice had only
the firelight to read by, then reading the small print began to tell its tale.
You know how bad it is for the eyesight to read any print by firelight, and
it must be very much worse when the print is very small; and so Furrin
would say to Purrin, “My eyes are getting quite dim, so now you must
read;” and before Purrin had read a page he would say the same thing to
Tod, and then Tod would try; but after a time their eyes became so dim
they couldn’t see at all, and so they had to invent stories to tell little Gilliflower;
so the poor little mice went quite blind, trying to amuse their little
girl friend.</p>

<p class='c008'>I took what care of them I could; but their blindness was very sad
for them. No longer had Purrin the heart to sing or Furrin to dance and
jest. Only they would sit close together, each holding one of Tod’s hands,
and listening to his stories, for he kept his spirits best, and did all he could
to cheer the others. All the marketing fell to me then, and it gave me
plenty to do; for, poor souls, the only amusement left them was a dainty
morsel, now and then.</p>

<p class='c008'>And, by and by, they became so tired of sitting still, when Tod had
exhausted all his stock of stories, that they got reckless, and would go
blundering about the house after Dame Marjoram, whom they knew by
the rustle of her silken
skirt, and the tapping of
her high-heeled shoes.
They all ran after her,
forgetting, that although
they could not see her,
still she could see them,
and trying to follow her
into her store-room,
where the almonds, and
raisins, and sugar, and
candied-peel were kept.</p>

</div>

<div  class='figright id018'>
<img src='images/illus027b.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'>I told them she would get angry, and that harm would come of it;
but I think their unhappiness and dulness made them quite foolhardy, for
they still went on, getting under her feet, and well-nigh tripping her up;
clambering into the lard-pot before her very eyes; in short, doing a
thousand irritating and injudicious things day by day, until her patience was
quite worn out. And at last, when they scrambled on to the dinner-table,
thinking it to be the store-room shelf, and sat all in a row, quietly eating
out of Miss Gilliflower’s plate, Dame Marjoram, who had the carving-knife
in her hand, thought it high time for them to have a lesson in manners.
So, thinking the knife was turned blunt side downwards, she rapped them
smartly across their three tails. What
was her horror and their dismay, to find
them cut off quite cleanly. The little
tails lay still on the table, and the three
little mice, well-nigh crazed with terror
and pain, groped their way off the table
and out of the room.</p>

<p class='c008'>I was returning from the cheese-room,
and met them crossing the great
hall.</p>

<p class='c008'>Of course, I took in at a glance all that had occurred, and I must
say that I felt but little surprise, though much sorrow. I guided them to
our old haunt in the loft-roof and then sat down to prepare a Memorial
for Dame Marjoram, giving a full account of all that they had suffered for
the sake of her family.</p>

<div  class='figleft id019'>
<img src='images/illus028a.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'>This I placed on the top of the key-basket;
and while she was reading it, with my usual tact
I silently brought in Purrin, Furrin, and Tod, and
pushed them forward in front of her.</p>

<p class='c008'>The tears stood in her eyes as she finished
reading my scroll, and from that time forth nothing
was too good for the Three Blind Mice. The good
wife even tried to make new tails for them.</p>

<p class='c008'>But they did not live long to enjoy their new happiness. The loss of
their sight, followed by the shock of having their tails cut off, was too much
for them. They never quite recovered, but died, all on the same day,
within the same hour, just a month afterward.</p>

<p class='c008'>Their three little graves were made beneath the shadows of a
lavender bush in the garden.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sometimes I go there to scatter a flower or two, and to shed a tear
to the memory of Purrin, Furrin, and Tod.</p>

</div>
<h3 class='c006'>VI—THE LILACS.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>There was a great clump of lilac bushes out by the garden wall.
These lilacs grew close together and made a thick hedge nearly
around a little plot of ground, where the grass grew so thick and
velvety that it was like a great green rug, and they bent their tall
heads over this little green plot, and so formed a lovely summer-house.</p>

<p class='c008'>Here we used to sew for our dolls, and here we used to give tea-parties.
Raspberry shortcake was one of the dainties we used to have.
This is the way we made it: Take a nice clean raspberry leaf, heap
it with raspberries, and put another leaf on top. Eat at once.</p>

<p class='c008'>In this lovely summer-house I used to keep school. I had a row
of bricks for scholars. Each brick had its own name. Two or three
of the bricks were nice and red and new. I named those new bricks
after my dearest little school-friends.</p>

<p class='c008'>The rest of the bricks were either broken or blackened a little.
Those bricks were my naughty, idle scholars. I used to stand them
up in a row to learn their lessons. The first thing I knew those bad
bricks would all tumble down in a heap. Numbers of little lilac-switches
grew about my schoolhouse, and I fear I was a severe teacher.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the lilacs were in bloom, that dear little summer-house was
a very gay little place. The great, purple plumes would nod in every
little wind that blew. The air was full of sweetness. Butterflies
made the trees bright with their slowly-waving wings. There was a
drowsy hum of many bees. Sometimes we would catch hold of one
of the slender trunks of the lilac trees, and give it a smart shake.
Away would flash a bright cloud of butterflies, and a swarm of angry,
buzzing bees!</p>

<p class='c008'>Pleasant Sabbath afternoons, we used to take our Sunday-school
books out under the lilacs to read. And as we read about good deeds
and unselfish lives, our own choir of birds would sing sweet hymns.
Then we would look up and smile, and say, “They have good singing
at the lilac church, don’t they?”</p>

<h3 class='c006'>VII.—THE SAND-BANK.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>That sand-bank in the pasture was one of the nicest of our playhouses.
There was neither dust nor dirt in it—nothing but
clean, fine sand, with now and then a pebble. It was not high, so there
was no danger of a great mass of sand falling down on us two children.</p>

<p class='c008'>The sand-bank was not very far from the little brook. Myra and
I would carry pailful after pailful of water from the brook to it, until
we had moistened a large quantity of sand. Sometimes we would
cover our little bare feet with the cool, wet sand, packing it just as
close as we could. Then gently, O, so gently, we would pull our feet
out from under the sand. The little “five-toed caves” as we used to
call them, would show just as plain as could be, where our little feet
had been! We used to catch little toads and put them into those little
damp caves, but they would soon hop out.</p>

<p class='c008'>We used to make the nicest pies and cakes and cookies out of that
lovely wet sand. We used to wish our sand-dainties were fit to eat!</p>

<p class='c008'>Oftentimes, when we were tired of cooking, we would go to work
and lay out a wonderful garden with tiny flower-beds and winding
paths, out of that wet sand. Some of those flower-beds were star-shaped,
some were round as a wheel, and some were square. We
used to gather handfuls of wild-flowers and stick them down in, until
every tiny bed blossomed into pink and blue and white and gold!</p>

<p class='c008'>We used to make sand-preserves out there. The time and the
patience that we used up in filling narrow-necked bottles with sand!
After a bottle was well-filled and shaken down, we would catch up
that bottle and run down to the brook. We would wash the outside
of that bottle until it shone like cut-glass, and then we would pack it
away in a hollow stump that we called our preserve-closet.</p>

<p class='c008'>We used to play a game that we called “Hop-scotch” out in the old
sand-bank. In this game, you mark the sand off into rather large
squares. Then hopping along on one foot, you try with your toe to
push a pebble from one square into another.</p>

</div>
<h3 class='c006'>VIII.—THE OLD PASTURE.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>I used to play a great deal out in the old pasture. It had a clump
of cradle-knolls in it. A cradle-knoll is a little mound of moss.</p>

<p class='c008'>On these mossy little cradle-knolls, checkerberry leaves and berries
used to grow. How delicious those spicy young checkerberry leaves
tasted! And we hunted those red plums as a cat hunts a mouse!</p>

<p class='c008'>The pasture had two or three well-beaten paths in it, that the
cows had made by their sober steady tramping back and forth from
the barnyard lane to the growth of little trees and bushes and tender
grass at the back. At sunset-time, two little barefooted girls would
“spat” along those cool smooth winding paths after those cows.</p>

<p class='c008'>As long as we kept in the paths our little feet were all right. But
sometimes a clump of bright wild-flowers tempted us, and then two
sorry little girls with thistle-prickles in their feet would come limping
back. But out where the tender grasses grew there were no thistles,
and such fun as hide-and-seek used to be among the bushes!</p>

<p class='c008'>Sometimes we could not find the cows very readily; and then we
would climb up on a smutty stump and call, “co’ boss! co’ boss!” until
the woods rang.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the spring, we would go a-maying out in the old pasture, and
O, such great handfuls of the sweet mayflower as we used to bring
home! Later on, we would gather great bunches of sweet-smelling
herbs that grew wild out there, and carry them home to hang up in
the shed-chamber and dry.</p>

<p class='c008'>If one of my schoolmates had been unkind to me, I would go out
into the old pasture, and there I would plan out for myself a lovely
future wherein I should be <i>very</i> rich and <i>very</i> good to the poor. And
my unkind schoolmate would be one of the humble receivers of my
gifts, and so it would come about that before I got through building
air-castles I would actually feel sorry for the poor schoolmate who
had ill-used me. And then home I would go, singing and skipping!</p>

<h3 class='c006'>IX.—THE ELM-TREE.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>Out in one of the meadows was a big elm-tree. It was very tall,
and in summer it looked like a monster bunch of green plumes.</p>

<p class='c008'>It stood on the bank of our little brook. Right where the old elm
stood, the bank was quite high, six feet almost. The boughs on the
old tree grew very low. I would catch hold of one of those low-hanging
boughs. Then, I would give a little run and jump. Away
out over the bank and over the brook I would swing!</p>

<p class='c008'>Oftentimes I would take my patchwork out under the old elm.
But soon the patchwork would be on the ground, forgotten, and an
idle little girl would be lying flat on the grass, with her hands clasped
under her head, looking up into the clear blue sky!</p>

<p class='c008'>I used to make believe that the white clouds were my ships, coming
into harbor under full sail. And I used to make up fine names for
my ships, and O, such splendid cargoes as they would be loaded with,
all for me—their rich young owner—the idle dreamer in the grass!</p>

<p class='c008'>O, it was such fun to lie there in the midst of funny daisies with
their high white collars, and buttercups with their yellow caps! The
roguish little winds would make them bend over and tickle the rosy
face of the little girl whom the birds and the brook had almost hushed
off to sleep. There would be a soft little touch on my forehead, and
then another on my chin, and yet others on my cheeks. Then I
would open my eyes and laugh at those funny little white and gold
heads, soberly wagging up and down. But once I was rather frightened
out under the old elm. I had been lying flat on my back for an
hour or two, when I was called. I half raised myself up and answered.
My hand was on the ground just where I had been lying. I felt
something squirming around my thumb. It was a tiny brown snake!
Of course, it was as harmless as a fly, but didn’t I spring to my feet!</p>

<p class='c008'>When I had to recite a little piece in school or at a church concert,
I always used to rehearse that little piece out under the old elm, over
and over again.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'><i>TIC-TAC-TOO.</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>Tic-tac-too was a little boy; he was exactly three years old, and the
youngest in the family; so, of course, he was the king. His real name
was Alec; but he was always known in the household, and among his
wide circle of friends generally, as Tic-tac-too. There was a little story to
account for this, and it is that story which I am now going to tell.</p>

<div  class='figleft id028'>
<img src='images/illus043.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'>There are very few children who do not know the funny old nursery rhyme
of “Tic-tac-too;” it is an old-fashioned rhyme, and in great vogue amongst
nurses. Of course Alec enjoyed it, and liked to have his toes pulled, and the
queer words said to him. But that is not the story; for it is one thing to like
a nursery rhyme very much, and another to be
called by the name of that rhyme, and nothing
else.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now, please, listen to the story.</p>

<p class='c008'>There was no nicer house to live in than
Daisy Farm: it was old-fashioned and roomy;
there were heaps of small bedrooms
with low ceilings, and heaps
of long passages, and unexpected
turnings, and dear little cosey corners;
and there was a large nursery
made out of two or three of
the small rooms thrown together,
and this nursery had casement
windows, and from the windows
the daisies, which gave their name
to the farm, could be seen. They
came up in thousands upon thousands,
and no power of man and scythe combined could keep them down.
The mowing-machine only suppressed them for a day or two; up they started
anew in their snowy dresses, with their modest pink frills and bright yellow
edges.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Rogers, who owned Daisy Farm, objected to the flowers; but his
children delighted in them, and picked them in baskets-full, and made daisy-chains
to their hearts’ content. There were several children who lived in this
pleasant farmhouse, for Tic-tac-too had many brothers and sisters. The old-fashioned
nursery was all that a modern nursery should be; it had deep cupboards
for toys, and each child had his or her wide shelf to keep special
treasures on; and the window-ledges were cosey places to curl up in on wet
days, when the rain beat outside, and the wind sighed, and
even the daisies looked as if they did not like to be washed
so much.</p>

<div  class='figright id029'>
<img src='images/illus044a.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'>Some of the children at Daisy Farm were old enough to
have governesses and masters, to have a schoolroom for
themselves, and, in short, to have very little to say to the
nursery; but still there were four nursery little ones; and one
day mother electrified the children by telling them that
another little boy was coming to pay them a visit.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He is coming to-morrow,” said mother; “he is a year
younger than Alec here, but his mother has asked us to take
care of him. You must all be kind to the little baby
stranger, children, and try your very best to make him feel at
home. Poor little man, I trust he will be happy with us.”</p>

<div  class='figleft id030'>
<img src='images/illus044b.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'>Mother sighed as she spoke; and when she did this, Rosie, the eldest
nursery child, looked up at her quickly. Rosie had dark gray eyes, and a very
sympathetic face; she was the kind of child who
felt everybody’s troubles, and nurse said she did
this far more than was good for her.</p>

<p class='c008'>The moment her mother left the room, Rosie
ran up to her nurse, and spoke eagerly—</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why did mother sigh when she said a new
little boy was coming here, nursie?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, my love, how can I tell? People sigh
most likely from habit, and from no reason whatever.
There’s nothing to fret anybody in a sigh,
Miss Rosie.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But mother doesn’t sigh from habit,” answered Rosie; “I expect there’s
going to be something sad about the new little boy, and I wonder what it is.
Harry, shall we collect some of our very nicest toys to have ready for the poor
little new boy?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Harry was six; he had a determined face, and was not so generous as
Rosie.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll not give away my skin-horse,” he said, “so you needn’t think it, nor
my white dog with the joints; there are some broken things down in that
corner that he can have. But I don’t see why a new baby should have my
best toys. Gee-up, Alec! you’re a horse, you know, and I’m going to race
you from one end of the nursery to the other—now trot!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Fat little curly-headed Alec started off good-humoredly, and Rosie surveyed
her own shelf to see which toys would most distract the attention of
the little stranger.</p>

<p class='c008'>She was standing on a hassock, and counting her treasures over carefully,
when she was startled by a loud exclamation from nurse.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mercy me! If that ain’t the telegraph boy coming up the drive!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Nurse was old-fashioned enough still to regard telegrams with apprehension.
She often said she could never look at one of those awful yellow
envelopes, without her heart jumping into her mouth; and these fears she had,
to a certain extent, infected the children with.</p>

<p class='c008'>Harry dropped Alec’s reins, and rushed to the window; Rosie forgot
her toys, and did likewise; Jack and Alec both pressed for a view from
behind.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Me, me, me, me want to see!” screamed baby Alec from the back.</p>

<p class='c008'>Nurse lifted him into her arms; as she did so, she murmured under her
breath,—</p>

<p class='c008'>“God preserve us! I hope that awful boy isn’t bringing us anything bad.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Rosie heard the words, and felt a sudden sense of chill and anxiety; she
pressed her little hand into nurse’s, and longed more than ever to give all the
nicest toys to the new little boy.</p>

<p class='c008'>Just then the nursery door was opened, and Kate, the housemaid, appeared,
carrying the yellow envelope daintily between her finger and thumb.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There, nurse,” she said, “it’s for you; and I hope, I’m sure, it’s no ill-luck
I’m bringing you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, sake’s alive!” said nurse. “Children, dears, let me sit down.
That awful boy to bring it to me! Well, the will of the Lord must be done;
whatever’s inside this ugly thing? Miss Rosie, my dear, could you hunt
round somewhere for my spectacles?”</p>

<p class='c008'>It always took a long time to find nurse’s spectacles; and Rosie, after
a frantic search, in which she was joined by all the other nursery children,
discovered them at last at the bottom of Alec’s cot. She rushed with them
to the old woman, who put them on her nose, and began deliberately to read
the contents of her telegram.</p>

<p class='c008'>The children stood round her as she did so. They were all breathless
and excited; and Rosie looked absolutely white from anxiety.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, my dears,” said nurse at last, when she had spelt through the
words, “it ain’t exactly a trouble; far from me to say that; but all the same,
it’s mighty contrary, and a new child coming here, and all.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What is it, nurse?” said Harry. “<i>Do</i> tell us what it’s all about.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s my daughter, dears,” said nurse; “she’ll be in London to-morrow, on
her way back to America.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, nurse!” said Rosie, “not your daughter Ann?”</p>

<div  class='figright id031'>
<img src='images/illus046.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'>“The same, my love; she that has eight children, and four of them with
carrotty hair. She wants me to go up to London,
to see her to-morrow; that’s the news the
telegraph boy has brought, Miss Rosie. My
daughter Ann says, ‘Mother, meet me to-morrow
at aunt’s, at two o’clock.’ Well, well, it’s mighty
contrary; and that new child coming, and all!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But you’ll have to go, nurse. It would be
dreadful for your daughter Ann not to see you again.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, dear, that’s all very fine; but what’s to become
of all you children? How is this blessed baby to get on
without his old Nan?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, nurse, you <i>must</i> go! It would be so cruel if
you didn’t,” exclaimed Rosie.</p>

<p class='c008'>Nurse sat thinking hard for a minute or two; then saying she would go
and consult her mistress, she left the room.</p>

<p class='c008'>The upshot of all this was, that at an early hour the following morning
nurse started for London, and a girl, of the name of Patience, from the village,
came up to take her place in the nursery.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mrs. Rogers was particularly busy during these days. She had some
friends staying with her, and in addition to this her eldest daughter, Ethel,
was ill, and took up a good deal of her mother’s time; in consequence of
these things the nursery children were left entirely to the tender mercies of
Patience.</p>

<p class='c008'>Not that that mattered much, for they were independent children, and
always found their own amusements. The first day of nurse’s absence, too,
was fine, and they spent the greater part of it in the open air; but the second
day was wet—a hopelessly wet day—a dull day with a drizzling fog, and no
prospect whatever of clearing up.</p>

<p class='c008'>The morning’s post brought a letter from nurse to ask for further leave of
absence; and this, in itself, would have depressed the spirits of the nursery
children, for they were looking forward to a gay supper with her, and a
long talk about her daughter Ann, and all her London adventures.</p>

<div  class='figleft id032'>
<img src='images/illus047.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'>But this was not the real
trouble which pressed so heavily
on Rosie’s motherly heart; the
real anxiety which made her little
face look so careworn was caused
by the new baby, the little boy of
two years old, who had arrived
late the night before, and now sat
with a shadow on his face, absolutely
refusing to make friends
with any one.</p>

<p class='c008'>He must have been a petted
little boy at home, for he was
beautifully dressed, and his curly
hair was nicely cared for, and his
fair face had a delicate peach
bloom about it; but if he was
petted, he was also, perhaps,
spoilt, for he certainly would not
make advances to any of his new
comrades, nor exert himself to be agreeable, nor to overcome the strangeness
which was filling his baby mind. Had nurse been at home, she would have
known how to manage; she would have coaxed smiles from little Fred, and
taken him up in her arms, and “mothered” him a good bit. Babies of two
require a great lot of “mothering,” and it is surprising what desolation fills
their little souls when it is denied them.</p>

<p class='c008'>Fred cried while Patience was dressing him; he got almost into a passion
when she washed his face, and he sulked over his breakfast. Patience was
not at all the sort of girl to manage a child like Fred; she was rough in every
sense of the word; and when rough petting failed, she tried the effect of
rough scolding.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come, baby, come, you <i>must</i> eat your bread and milk. No nonsense
now, open your mouth and gobble it down. Come, come, I’ll slap you if you
don’t.”</p>

<p class='c008'>But baby Fred, though sorrowful, was not a coward; he pushed the bowl
of bread and milk away, upset its contents over the clean tablecloth, and
raised two sorrowful big eyes to the new nurse’s face.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Naughty dirl, do away,” he said; “Fred don’t ’ove ’oo. Fred won’t
eat bekfus’.”</p>

<div  class='figright id033'>
<img src='images/illus048.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Miss Rosie, what
a handful he is!” said
Patience.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Let me try him!”
said Rosie; “I’ll make him
eat something. Come Freddy
darling, you love Rosie,
don’t you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, I don’t,” said Fred.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, you’ll eat some breakfast; come now.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I won’t eat none bekfus’—do away.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Rosie turned round and looked in a despairing way at
her own three brothers.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If only nurse were at home!” she said.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Master Fred,” said Patience, “if you won’t eat, you must get down from
the breakfast-table. I have got to clear up, you know.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She popped the little boy on the floor. He looked round in a bewildered
fashion.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Let’s have a very exciting kind of play, and perhaps he’ll join in,” said
Rosie, in a whisper. “Let’s play at kittens—that’s the loveliest of all our
games.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Kittens” was by no means a quiet pastime. It consisted, indeed, in wild
romps on all-fours, each child assuming for the time the character of a kitten,
and jumping after balls of paper, which they caught in their mouths.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s the happiest of all our games, and perhaps he’ll like it,” said Rosie.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Patie,” said Alec, going up to the new nurse, “does ’oo know <i>Tic-tac-too</i>?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course I do, master Baby—a silly game that.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I ’ike it,” said little Alec.</p>

<p class='c008'>He tripped across the nursery to the younger baby, and sat down by his
side.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Take off ’oo shoe,” he said.</p>

<p class='c008'>Fred was very tired of being cross and miserable. He could not say he
was too little to Alec, for Alec was scarcely bigger than himself. Besides he
understood about taking off his shoe. It was a performance he particularly
liked. He looked at Baby Alec, and obeyed him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Take off ’oo other shoe,” said Alec.</p>

<p class='c008'>Fred did so.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Pull off ’oo ’tocks,” ordered the eldest baby.</p>

<p class='c008'>Fred absolutely chuckled as he tugged away at his white socks, and
revealed his pink toes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now, come to Patie.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Fred scrambled to his feet, and holding Alec’s hand, trotted down the long
nursery.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Patie,” said Alec, “take F’ed on ’our lap, and play <i>Tic-tac-too</i> for
him?”</p>

<div  class='figright id034'>
<img src='images/illus049.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'>Patience was busy sewing; she
raised her eyes. Two smiling little
baby-boys were standing by her knee.
Could this child, whose blue eyes were
full of sunshine, be the miserable little
Fred?</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, master Alec,” she said, kissing
the older baby, “you’re a perfect
little darling. Well, I never! to think
of you finding out a way to please that
poor child.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Tic-tac-too!” said Fred, in a loud
and vigorous voice. He was fast getting
over his shyness, and Alec’s game
suited him to perfection.</p>

<p class='c008'>But the little stranger did <i>not</i> like the game of kittens. He marched in a
fat, solid sort of way across the nursery, and sat down in a corner, with his
back to the company. Here he really looked a most dismal little figure. The
view of his back was heart-rending; his curly head drooped slightly, forlornness
was written all over his little person.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What a little muff he is!” said Harry; “I’m glad I didn’t give my skin
horse to him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, don’t,” said Rosie, “can’t you see he’s unhappy? I must go and
speak to him. Fred,” she said, going up to the child, “come and play with
Alec and me.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id035'>
<img src='images/illus050.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'>“No,” said Fred, “I’se too little to p’ay.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But we’ll have such an easy play, Fred. <i>Do</i> come; I wish you would.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’se too little,” answered Fred, shaking his head again.</p>

<p class='c008'>At that moment Rosie and her two elder brothers were called out of the
room to their morning lessons. Rosie’s heart ached as she went away.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Something must be done,” she said to herself. “That new little boy-baby
will get quite ill if we can’t think of something to please him soon.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She did not know that a very unexpected little deliverer was at hand. The
two babies were now alone in the nursery, and Patience, having finished her
tidying up, sat down to her sewing.</p>

<p class='c008'>Patience lifted him on her lap, popped him down with a bounce, kissed
him, and began,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Tic, tac, too,</div>
      <div class='line'>The little horse has lost his shoe,</div>
      <div class='line'>Here a nail, and there a nail,</div>
      <div class='line'>Here a nail, and there a nail,</div>
      <div class='line in16'>Tic, tac, too!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>When the other children returned to the nursery, they heard peals of
merry baby laughter; and this was the fashion in which a little boy won his
name.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>“HOW MAMA USED TO PLAY.”</h2>
</div>
<h3 class='c006'>X.—THE PASTURE FENCE.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>We used to play a great deal about the pasture fence. It was a
high rail fence and we used to take a little pole in both hands
as a balancing pole, and run along on the top. Carefully we balanced
ourselves as we ran! But finally we would tip first one way and then
the other, and then, with a little laughing scream, off we’d topple!</p>

<p class='c008'>Sometimes we would put a board through the fence and have a fine
time at “seesaw.” Up one of us would go, high in the air, and down
would go the other with a thud!</p>

<p class='c008'>We used to play that the pasture fence was a huge cupboard.
Each rail was a shelf. Many of those rail-shelves were loaded down
with bits of broken dishes, shining pebbles, bits of green moss that we
called “pincushions,” and white clam-shells full of strawberries, or
raspberries, or little dark juicy choke-cherries. The contents of the
clam-shells were for the birds. If we found a clam-shell lying on the
ground, we believed with all our little hearts that a little winged
creature had been fed from our cupboard.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sometimes we would carry on a thriving millinery store out at the
pasture fence. We would make queer little bonnets out of birch-bark.
Then we would sew wildflowers on the bonnets and lay them on the
rails of the fence for sale. Such a number of those funny little bonnets
as would be on exhibition on our rail-counters!</p>

<p class='c008'>One of the big upright posts of our rail fence was hollow a little
way down. One day we found on the ground a nest full of birdlings;
one of them was dead, and a little green snake had almost reached the
nest. The mother-bird was flying about crying pitifully. I snatched
the nest away and carried it O, so carefully to the pasture fence and
put it down in the hollow of the fence-post. Then we went a bit
away and waited. Pretty soon there was a little rush of wings; and
soon the mother-bird settled down in that hollow post just as cunning
as could be. And that dear little family staid in that hollow post
until the baby-birds grew up and flew away.</p>

</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>Lulu was six years old last spring. She came to make a visit

<div  class='figcenter id022'>

</div>

<p class='c008'>Lulu had lived away down in Cuba ever since she was a year old.
Her cousins had written to her what a good time they had on
Thanksgiving Day; so she was very anxious to be at her grandfather’s
at that time. They do not have a Thanksgiving Day down
in Cuba. That is how Lulu did not have one until she was six
years old.</p>

<p class='c008'>She could hardly wait for the day to come. Such a grand time as
they did have! Lulu did not know she had so many cousins until
they came to spend the day at her grandfather’s. It did not take
them long to get acquainted. Before time for dinner they felt as if

<p class='c008'>The dinner was the grand event of the
day. Lulu had never seen so long a
table except at a hotel, nor some
of the vegetables and kinds of
pie.</p>

<p class='c008'>Lulu had never tasted
turkey before. Her
grandmother would
not have one cooked until
then, so she could say that
she had eaten her first piece
of turkey on Thanksgiving
Day.</p>

<p class='c008'>After dinner they played
all kinds of games. All the uncles and aunts and grown-up cousins
played blind-man’s-buff with them.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>“HOW MAMA USED TO PLAY.”</h2>
</div>
<h3 class='c006'>XI.—OUR RAINY-DAY PLAYHOUSE.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>We had a number of rainy-day playhouses. When it did not
rain very hard, Myra and I would scamper out to our little
playhouse made of boards, and listen to the patter of the drops.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was not a very costly playhouse. It was built in a corner made
by the shed and the orchard fence. One side of our playhouse was
the shed. Another side was the fence; this open side we used to call
our bay-window. A creeping hop vine twined around the rough
fence-boards and made a green lace curtain for our bay-window.
The third side was made of boards. Across this side stretched the
wide board seat, which was the only furniture of our playhouse. The
fourth, or front side of the playhouse consisted mostly of a “double-door,”
of which we were very proud. This double-door was two large
green blinds. Did not we feel like truly little housekeepers when we
fastened those two blinds together with a snap!</p>

<p class='c008'>When the rain came down in gentle showers we used to go out to
the little playhouse and have a concert. First Myra would step up on
to that wide board seat and recite a little piece. Then I would step
up on to the seat and sing a little song. Perhaps while I was singing
a robin in the orchard would begin to sing, O, so loud and sweet that
all the orchard just rang with that sweet music! We would stop our
concert and listen to the robin. When he had finished, we used to clap
our little hands. And all the time the rain kept up a fairy “tinkle,
tinkle,” as if some one was keeping time for us on a tiny piano.</p>

<p class='c008'>Spat-t! Spat-t! would come the little drops through a tiny hole in
the roof of our little house. We used to hold our faces up towards
that little leak in the roof. Oftentimes a drop would strike us fairly
on the tip of our small noses! Then how we would laugh!</p>

<p class='c008'>Sometimes we would take hold of hands and repeat together, over
and over again: “Rain, rain, go away, come again, another day!”</p>

<p class='c008'>And if we said those words long enough, the rain would go away!</p>

</div>
<h3 class='c006'>XII.—THE WHOLE WHITE WORLD.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>In winter we played everywhere! The whole white world was a
lovely playground! We had no skates, but we wore very thick-soled
boots that took the place of skates very well. At least we
thought so, and that was all we needed to make us contented. When
the little pond was frozen over, we would take a quick run down its
snowy banks and then we would skim clear across that little pond’s
frozen surface just as swift as a bird would skim through the air.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sometimes a thick frost would come in the night-time. The next
morning a fine blue haze would be in the air and everything would be
clothed in soft white frost-furs. As the sun rose higher and higher
we would watch to see the trees and bushes grow warm in the sunshine
and throw off their furs. Then we would try and catch those
soft furs as they fell. But if caught they melted quickly away.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the surface of the snow hardened enough so that we could walk
on the crust without breaking through, our happiness was complete.
High hills were all about us, and it seemed to us as if every shining
hill would say if it could, “Come and slide!”</p>

<p class='c008'>And O, the happy hours that we have had with our clumsy old
sled! Away we would go, the wind stinging our faces until crimson
roses blossomed in our cheeks, and the shining crust snapping and
creaking under our sled, and the hill flying away behind us!</p>

<p class='c008'>If a damp clinging snow came, it made lovely snowballs; and it was
such fun to catch hold of the long clothes-lines and shake them and
see little clumps of snow hop like rabbits from the line into the air.</p>

<p class='c008'>And if instead of warmth, and great damp feathery snowflakes,
there came a bitter wind and an icy sleet that froze as it fell—what
then? Never mind! Sunrise would set the whole world a-sparkle.
Every tree and bush would be gay with splendid ice-jewels! And in
the great shining ice palace, we could run and laugh and shout, watching
the ice-jewels loosen and fall, all day long.</p>

It was Uncle George who called her “Gran’ma” when she
was only six, and by the time she was seven everybody had
taken to the name, and she answered to it as a matter of
course.</p>

<p class='c008'>Why did he call her so? Because she was such a prim,
staid, serious, little old-fashioned body, and consequently
her mother laughingly took to dressing her in an old-fashioned
way, so that at last, whether she was out in the
grounds, or round by the stables with Grant, in her figured
pink dress, red sash, long gloves, and sun-bonnet, looking after her pets, or
indoors of an evening, in her yellow brocade, muslin apron—with pockets, of
course, and quaint mob cap tied up with its ribbon—she always looked serious
and grandmotherly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is her nature to,” Uncle George said, quoting from “Let dogs
delight;” and when he laughed at her, Gran’ma used to look at him wonderingly
in the most quaint way, and then put her hand in his, and ask him to
take her for a walk.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gran’ma lived in a roomy old house with a delightful garden, surrounded
by a very high red-brick wall that was covered in the spring with white blossoms,
and in the autumn with peaches with red cheeks that laughed at her and
imitated hers; purple plums covered with bloom, and other plums that looked
like drops of gold among the green leaves; and these used to get so ripe and
juicy in the hot sun, that they would crack and peer out at her as if asking to
be eaten before they fell down and wasted their rich honey juice on the ground.
Then there were great lumbering looking pears which worried John, the gardener,
because they grew so heavy that they tore the nails out of the walls, and
had to be fastened up again—old John giving Gran’ma the shreds to hold
while he went up the ladder with his hammer, and a nail in his mouth.</p>

<p class='c008'>That garden was Gran’ma’s world, it was so big; and on fine mornings she
could be seen seriously wandering about with Dinnywinkle, her little sister, up
this way, down that, under the apple-trees, along the gooseberry and currant
alleys, teaching her and Grant that it was not proper to go on the beds when
there were plenty of paths, and somehow Dinnywinkle, who was always
bubbling over with fun, did as the serious little thing told her in the most obedient
of ways, and helped her to scold Grant, who was much harder to teach.</p>

<div  class='figright id039'>
<img src='images/illus060.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'>For Grant, whose papa was a setter, and mamma a very lady-like retriever,
always had ideas in his head that there were wild
beasts hiding in the big garden, and as soon as his
collar was unfastened, and he was taken down the
grounds for a run, he seemed to run
mad. His ears went up, his tail began
to wave, and he dashed about frantically
to hunt for those imaginary wild
beasts. He barked till he was hoarse
sometimes, when after a good deal of
rushing about he made a discovery, and
would then look up triumphantly at
Gran’ma, and point at his find with his
nose, till she came up to see what he
had discovered. One time it would be
a snail, at another a dead mouse killed
by the cat, and not eaten because it was
a shrew. Upon one occasion, when
the children ran up, it was to find the
dog half wild as he barked to them to come and see what he was holding
down under his paw,—this proving to be an unfortunate frog which uttered
a dismal squeal from time to time till Gran’ma set it at liberty, so that it could
make long hops into a bed of ivy, where it lived happily long afterwards, to
sit there on soft wet nights under a big leaf like an umbrella, and softly whistle
the frog song which ends every now and then in a croak.</p>

<p class='c008'>Grant was always obedient when he was caught, and then he would walk
steadily along between Gran’ma and Dinny, each holding one of his long silky
ears, with the prisoner making no effort to escape.</p>

<p class='c008'>But the job was to catch him; and on these occasions Gran’ma used to run
and run fast, while Dinny ran in another direction to cut Grant off.</p>

<div  class='figleft id040'>
<img src='images/illus061.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'>And a pretty chase he led them, letting them get close up, and then giving
a joyous bark and leaping sidewise, to dash off in quite a fresh direction.
Here he would perhaps hide, crouching down under one of the shrubs, ready
to pounce out on his pursuers, and then dash away again, showing his teeth as
if he were laughing, and in his frantic delight waltzing round and round after
his tail. Then away he would bound on to the closely shaven lawn, throw
himself down, roll over and over, and set Dinny laughing and clapping her
hands to see him play one of his favorite tricks, which was to lay his nose
down close to the grass, first on one side
and then on the other, pushing it along as
if it was a plough, till he sprang up and
stood barking and wagging his tail, as
much as to say, “What do you think of
that for a game?” ending by running helter-skelter
after a blackbird which flew away,
crying “Chink—chink—chink.”</p>

<p class='c008'>That was a famous old wilderness of a
place, with great stables and out-houses,
where there was bright golden straw, and
delicious sweet-scented hay, and in one
place a large bin with a lid, and half-full of
oats, with which Gran’ma used to fill a
little cross-handled basket.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now, Grant,” she cried, as she shut
down the lid, after refusing to let Dinny
stand in the bin and pour oats over her head and down her back—“Now,
Grant!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Wuph!” said Grant, and he took hold of the basket in his teeth, and
trotted on with it before her round the corner, to stop before the hutches that
stood outside in the sun.</p>

<p class='c008'>Here, if Dinny was what Gran’ma called “a good girl,” she had a treat.
For this was where the rabbits lived.</p>

<p class='c008'>Old Brownsmith sent those rabbits, hutch and all, as a present for Gran’ma,
one day when John went to the market garden with his barrow to fetch what
he called some “plarnts;” and when he came back with the barred hutch, and
set the barrow down in the walk, mamma went out with Gran’ma and Dinny,
to look at them, and Grant came up growling, sniffed all round the hutch before
giving a long loud bark, which, being put into plain English, meant, “Open
the door, and I’ll kill all the lot.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t know what to say, John,” said mamma, shaking her head. “It
is very kind of Mr. Brownsmith, but I don’t think your master will like the
children to keep them, for fear they should be neglected and die.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“’Gleckted?” said old John, rubbing one ear. “What! little miss here
’gleck ’em? Not she. You’ll feed them rabbuds reg’lar, miss, wontcher?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Gran’ma said she would, and the hutch was wheeled round by the stables,
Grant following and looking very much puzzled, for though he never hunted
the cats now, rabbits did seem the right things to kill.</p>

<p class='c008'>But Gran’ma soon taught him better, and he became the best of friends
with Brown Downie and her two children, Bunny and White Paws.</p>

<p class='c008'>In fact, one day there was a scene, for Cook rushed into the schoolroom
during lesson time, out of breath with excitement.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Please’m, I went down the garden, ’m, to get some parsley, and that
horrid dog’s hunting the rabbits, and killing ’em.”</p>

<p class='c008'>There was a cry from both children, and Gran’ma rushed out and round to
the stables, to find the hutch door unfastened, and the rabbits gone, while, as
she turned back to the house with the tears running down her cheeks, who
should come trotting up but Grant, with his ears cocked, and Bunny hanging
from his jaws as if dead.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gran’ma uttered a cry; and as Mamma came up with Dinny, the dog set
the little rabbit down, looked up and barked, and Bunny began loping off to
nibble the flowers, not a bit the worse, while Grant ran and turned him back
with his nose, for Gran’ma to catch the little thing up in her arms.</p>

<p class='c008'>Grant barked excitedly, and ran down the garden again, the whole party
following, and in five minutes he had caught White Paw.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dinny had the carrying of this truant, and with another bark, Grant dashed
in among the gooseberry bushes, where there was a great deal of rustling,
a glimpse of something brown, and then of a white cottony tail. Then in
spite of poor Grant getting his nose pricked with the thorns, Brown Downie
was caught and held by her ears till mamma lifted her up, and she was
carried in triumph back, Grant trotting on before, and leading the way to the
stable-yard and the hutch, turning round every now and then to bark.</p>

<p class='c008'>The rabbits did not get out again, and every morning and evening they were
fed as regularly as Gran’ma fed herself.</p>

<p class='c008'>On reaching the hutch, Grant set the basket down, leaving the handle rather
wet, though he could easily have wiped it with his ears, and then he sat down
in a dreamy way, half closing his eyes and possibly thinking about wild rabbits
on heaths where he could hunt them through furze bushes, while Gran’ma in
the most serious way possible opened the hutch door.</p>

<div  class='figright id041'>
<img src='images/illus063.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'>There was no difficulty about catching White Paw, for he was ready enough
to thrust his nose into
his little mistress’s
hand, and be lifted
out by his ears, and
held for Dinny to
stroke.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now let me take
him,” she cried.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, my dear, you
are too young yet,”
said Gran’ma; and
Dinny had to be content
with smoothing down White Paw’s soft brown fur, as it nestled up
against its mistress’s breast, till it was put back kicking, and evidently longing
to escape from its wooden-barred prison, even if it was to be hunted by Grant.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then Bunny had his turn, and was duly lifted out and smoothed; after
which, Brown Downie, who was too heavy to lift, gave the floor of the hutch a
sharp rap with one foot, making Grant lift his ear and utter a deep sigh.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No,” he must have thought; “it’s very tempting, but I must not seize
her by the back and give her a shake.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then the trough was filled with oats, the door fastened, and the girls looked
on as three noses were twitched and screwed about, and a low munching sound
arose.</p>

<p class='c008'>Three rabbits and a dog! Enough pets for any girl, my reader; but
Gran’ma had another—Buzz, a round, soft-furred kitten with about as much
fun in it as could be squeezed into so small a body. But Buzz had a temper,
possibly soured by jealousy of Grant, whom he utterly detested.</p>

<p class='c008'>Buzz’s idea of life was to be always chasing something,—his tail, a shadow,
the corner of the table-cover, or his mistress’s dress. He liked to climb, too, on
to tables, up the legs, into the coal-scuttle, behind the sideboard, and above
all, up the curtains, so as to turn the looped-up part into a hammock, and sleep
there for hours. Anywhere forbidden to a respectable kitten was Buzz’s favorite
spot, and especially inside the fender, where the blue tiles at the back
reflected the warmth of the fire, and the brown tiles of the hearth were so bright
that he could see other kittens in them, and play with them, dabbing at them
with his velvet paw.</p>

<p class='c008'>Buzz had been dragged out from that forbidden ground by his hind leg, and
by the loose skin at the back of his neck, and he had been punished again and
again, but still he would go, and strange to say, he took a fancy to rub himself
up against the upright brass dogs from the tip of his nose to the end of his
tail, and then repeat it on the other side.</p>

<p class='c008'>But Gran’ma’s pet did not trespass without suffering for it. Both his
whiskers were singed off close, and there was a brown, rough, ill-smelling
bit at the end of his tail where, in turning round, he had swept it amongst the
glowing cinders, giving him so much pain that he uttered a loud “Mee-yow!”
and bounded out of the room, looking up at Gran’ma the while as if he believed
that she had served him like that.</p>

<div  class='figleft id042'>
<img src='images/illus064.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'>In Gran’ma’s very small old-fashioned way, one of her regular duties was
to get papa’s blue cloth fur-lined slippers, and put them
against the fender to warm every night, ready for him
when he came back tired from London; and no sooner
were those slippers set down to toast, than Buzz, who
had been watching attentively, went softly from his
cushion where he had been pretending to be asleep, but
watching all the time with one eye, and carefully packed
himself in a slipper, thrusting his nose well down, drawing
his legs right under him, and snoozling up so
compactly that he exactly fitted it, and seemed part of a fur cushion made in
the shape of a shoe.</p>

<p class='c008'>But Buzz was not allowed to enjoy himself in that fashion for long. No
sooner did Gran’ma catch sight of what he had done than she got up, went to
the fireplace, gravely lifted the slipper, and poured Buzz out on to the hearth-rug,
replaced the slipper where it would warm, and went back, to find, five
minutes later, that the kitten had fitted himself into the other slipper, with
only his back visible, ready to be poured out again. Then, in a half-sulky,
cattish way, Buzz would go and seat himself on his square cushion, and watch,
while, to guard them from any more such intrusions, Gran’ma picked up the
slippers and held them to her breast until such time as her father came home.</p>

<p class='c008'>Those were joyous times at the old house, till one day there was a report
spread in the village that little Gran’ma was ill. The doctor’s carriage was
seen every day at the gate, and then twice a day, and there were sorrow and
despair where all had been so happy. Dinny went alone with Grant to feed
the rabbits; and there were no more joyous rushes round the garden, for the
dog would lie down on the doorstep with his head between his paws, and watch
there all day, and listen for the quiet little footstep that never came. Every
day old John, the gardener, brought up a bunch of flowers for the little child
lying fevered and weak, with nothing that would cool her burning head, and
three anxious faces were constantly gazing for the change that they prayed
might come.</p>

<p class='c008'>For the place seemed no longer the same without those pattering feet.
Cook had been found crying in a chair in the kitchen; and when asked why,
she said it was because Grant had howled in the night, and she knew now that
dear little Gran’ma would never be seen walking so sedately round the garden
again.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was of no use to tell her that Grant had howled because he was miserable
at not seeing his little mistress: she said she knew better.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t tell me,” she cried; “look at him.” And she pointed to where
the dog had just gone down to the gate, for a carriage had stopped, and the
dog, after meeting the doctor, walked up behind him to the house, waited till
he came out, and then walked down behind him to the gate, saw him go, and
came back to lie down in his old place on the step, with his head between his
paws.</p>

<p class='c008'>They said that they could not get Grant to eat, and it was quite true, for the
little hands which fed him were not there; and the house was very mournful and
still, even Dinny having ceased to shout and laugh, for they told her she
must be very quiet, because Gran’ma was so ill.</p>

<p class='c008'>From that hour Dinny went about the place like a mouse, and her favorite
place was on the step by Grant, who, after a time, took to laying his head in
her lap, and gazing up at her with his great brown eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>And they said that Gran’ma knew no one now, but lay talking quickly
about losing the rabbits and about Dinny and Grant; and then there came a
day when she said nothing, but lay very still as if asleep.</p>

<div  class='figleft id043'>
<img src='images/illus066.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'>That night as the doctor was going, he said softly that he could do no more,
but that those who loved the little quiet
child must pray to God to spare her to
them; and that night, too, while tears were
falling fast, and there seemed to be no
hope, Grant, in his loneliness and misery,
did utter a long, low, mournful howl.</p>

<p class='c008'>But next morning, after a weary night,
those who watched saw the bright glow of
returning day lighting up the eastern sky,
and the sun had not long risen before
Gran’ma woke as if from a long sleep,
looked up in her mother’s eyes as if she
knew her once more, and the great time of
peril was at an end.</p>

<p class='c008'>All through the worst no hands but her mother’s had touched her; but
now a nurse was brought in to help—a quiet, motherly, North-country woman
who one day stood at the door, and held up her hands in astonishment, for
she had been busy down-stairs for an hour, and now that she had returned
there was a great reception on the bed: Buzz was seated on the pillow purring;
the rabbits all three were playing at the bed being a warren, and loping
in and out from the valance; Grant was seated on a chair with his head close
up to his mistress’s breast; and Dinny was reading aloud from a picture storybook
like this, but the book was upside down, and she invented all she said.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Bless the bairn! what does this mean?” cried nurse.</p>

<p class='c008'>It meant that Dinny had brought up all Gran’ma’s friends, and that the
poor child was rapidly getting well.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>The Sunshine Corner</h2>
</div>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>Miss Myrtle read to the children this afternoon an Account
sent by her married cousin, Mrs. Pingry. Mrs. Pingry wrote:
“I spell it with a big A, just for fun, because it is of so small a matter,
but it was a sunshiny matter for it caused some smiling, and it brought
out real kindness from several persons.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mr. Pingry goes in on the 8.17 train and attends to his furnace
the last thing, allowing twelve minutes to reach the station. When
about half-way there, yesterday, it occurred to him that he forgot to
shut the drafts. Just then he met Jerry Snow, the man at the Binney
place, and asked him to please call round our way, and ask for Mrs.
Pingry, and say Mr. Pingry had left the drafts open. Jerry said he
would after going to the post-office, but Mr. Pingry, fearing Jerry
might forget, called hastily at the door of Madam Morey, an elderly
woman who does plain sewing, and said he forgot to shut the furnace
drafts; if she should see a boy passing would she ask him to call at
our door, and ask for Mrs. Pingry, and tell her? Madam said she
would be on the lookout for a boy, while doing her baking.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now as Mr. Pingry was hurrying on, it came to him that he had
not yet made a sure thing of it, and at that moment he saw the woman
who does chore-work at the Binney’s, coming by a path across the
field. He met her at the fence, and asked if she would go around by
our house and say to Mrs. Pingry that Mr. Pingry had left the drafts
all open. She agreed, and Mr. Pingry ran to his train, a happy man.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now Madam Morey felt anxious about the furnace, and stepped
often to the window, and at last spied a small boy with a sled, and
finding he knew where we live, told him Mr. Pingry went away and
forgot to shut the furnace drafts and wished to send back word,
and would the boy coast down that way and tell Mrs. Pingry? The
boy promised, and coasted down the hill.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Madam Morey still felt uneasy about the furnace, and not being
sure the boy would do the errand kept on the watch for another; and
when the banana-man stopped and made signs at her window ‘would
she buy?’ she wrote a few words on a bit of brown paper and went
with him far enough to point out the house and made signs, ‘would he
leave the paper there?’ He made signs ‘yes?’ and passed on.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now at about half-past eight, our front doorbell rang and I heard
a call for me. I hurried down, and received the chore-woman’s message
and acted upon it at once.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sometime afterwards, as I was in the back-chamber, I heard voices
outside and saw six or eight small boys trying to pull their sleds over
a fence, and wondered how they happened to be coasting in such a
place. Presently I heard a commotion on the other side and went to
the front windows. All the sleds were drawn up near the steps, and
the small boys were stamping around like an army come to take the
house. Seeing me they all shouted something at me. They seemed
so terribly in earnest, and came in such a strange way, that I flew
down, sure something dreadful had happened—perhaps Willy was
drowned! and I began to tremble. At sight of me at the door they
all shouted again, but I did not understand. I caught hold of the biggest
boy and pulled him inside, and said to him, in a low, tremulous
voice, ‘Tell me! What is it?’ He answered, in a bashful way, ‘Mr.
Pingry said he left the drafts open.’ ‘Thank you all!’ I said.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Next, the banana-man, bobbing his head, and making signs,
though I shook my head ‘no.’ Finally up came Bridget with a slip of
brown paper having written on it, but no name signed: ‘Your furnace
drafts are open.’ Such a shout as went up from us!</p>

<p class='c008'>“Grand company coming, I guess! exclaimed my sister, a short
time afterwards. Sure enough there stood a carriage and span. Jerry
Snow, it seems, forgot our furnace until he went to look at his own.
He was then just about to take Mrs. Binney out for an airing. He
mentioned it to her and she had him drive round with the message.</p>

<p class='c008'>“By this time we were ready to go off, explode, shout, giggle, at
the approach of any one; and when Madam Morey stepped up on our
piazza we bent ourselves double with laughter, and my sister went
down upon the floor all in a heap, saying, ‘Do—you—suppose—she—comes—for
that?’</p>

<p class='c008'>“Even so. She had worried, thinking the hot pipes might heat
the woodwork, and half-expected to hear the cry of ‘fire!’ and bells
ringing, and could not sit still in her chair, and in the goodness of her
heart she left her work and came all the way over!</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh! we had fun with Mr. Pingry that evening. But now, my
dear Miss Myrtle, the funniest part of all was that Mr. Pingry did not
forget to shut the drafts!”</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>THE GROCER’S BOY.</h2>
</div>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>Sammy Swattles wasn’t a bad boy, you understand; he was
simply thoughtless. He thoughtlessly did things which robbed
him of peace of mind for some time after he did them.</p>

<p class='c008'>When Sammy was ten years old he had to leave school, to go to
work for Mr. Greens, the grocer, in order to help support his mother.</p>

<p class='c008'>He did a great many things for the grocer, from seven o’clock in
the morning till six at night, but his principal work was to place large
paper bags on the scales and fill them with flour from the barrel.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the bag weighed twenty-three pounds, Sammy had to seal
it up and take it to the family it was ordered for. The grocer allowed
him two cents for every bag he carried, over and above his wages,
which were $2.50 per week. Some weeks Sammy made over $3.00
which helped his mother to run their little house quite comfortably.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now, Sammy, in his thoughtlessness, used to sample quite a good
deal of the grocer’s preserved ginger. Every time he would pass the
tin boxes of ginger, he would thoughtlessly take a piece, and it would
disappear in the recesses of Sammy’s rosy mouth.</p>

<p class='c008'>One night, after he had locked up all but the front door of the store,
he helped himself to quite a large piece of the ginger, and walked
home.</p>

<p class='c008'>He did not care for any supper that night. He felt as if bed was
the best place for his troubled little stomach.</p>

<p class='c008'>He hadn’t been in bed two minutes when a little fierce man, with a
white cloth round his black body and a huge grin on his ebony face,
bounded into his room.</p>

<p class='c008'>With a scream Sammy leaped out of bed and bounded out of the
window. With a yell the Indian was after him. Sammy flew down
the road like a runaway colt, the black man in his rear yelling like
thunder and lions. Sammy never ran so fast in his life, but the little
black man gained on him, and finally caught him!</p>

<p class='c008'>Sammy pleaded hard to be spared to his mother, but the little man
grimly took him by the collar, and with one leap landed him on the
island of Ceylon, in the Indian Ocean, at a place called Kandy. Then
he led Sammy out into the country, and blew a whistle. In an instant
they were surrounded by hundreds and hundreds of men, women and
boys, all as black as Sammy’s captor. Sammy cried:</p>

<p class='c008'>“What have I done! what have I done!” and they all cried:</p>

<p class='c008'>“You have taken the ginger that we have gathered by hard work,
without permission, and you are condemned to live here for the rest
of your life on ginger alone!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then Sammy began to cry real hard, for he thought of his poor
mother, off there in Massachusetts, wondering day after day, “What
has become of my Sammy!”</p>

<p class='c008'>And then to be compelled to eat nothing but ginger all his life!
It was awful! He already hated ginger. He looked so woebegone
that they all cried:</p>

<p class='c008'>“If you will promise to be good, and think before you do things,
we will let you go! But if you don’t keep your promise we’ll get you
again, and then, look out!”</p>

<p class='c008'>So Sammy promised, and ran for home. But the black people
seemed to regret having let him off so easily, and they all came trooping
after him!</p>

<p class='c008'>You should have seen Sammy run! He went over through India,
and across Afghanistan, Persia and Turkey like a streak of lightning!
He plunged into the Mediterranean and swam across to Italy.
From Italy he swam to Spain; and across Spain, from Tarragona to
Cape Finisterre, he ran like the Rapids of the River St. Lawrence, the
black people at his heels!</p>

<p class='c008'>He was almost exhausted as he dove off Cape Finisterre into the
broad Atlantic, and he would have sunk down deep, for fifteen or
twenty miles, if a friendly dolphin hadn’t come along and invited him
to ride on its shiny back!</p>

<p class='c008'>The black men gave up the chase then, and the dolphin swam over
to Massachusetts Bay, up Boston Harbor, to the Charles River, to the
bridge by Sammy’s home. There the dolphin said good-by, told
Sammy to always be a good boy, and then, with a flip of its tail, it
rushed down the river—and Sammy awoke!</p>

<p class='c008'>It had all been a dream, of course; but it cured Sammy of thoughtlesness,
and nobody ever had cause again to say that Sammy Swattles
wasn’t all a nice little boy should be. He told his employer all about
it, and his employer said: “Well, be a good boy, and never do anything
without thinking of whether it’s right or wrong to do it.”</p>

Last sum-mer when we were in the coun-try
hav-ing a hap-py ho-li-day, we of-ten went
in-to the hay-field, and you lit-tle ones may
fan-cy the fun we had. John-ny and Lil-ly
rolled in the sweet fresh hay, and were
bu-ried and came up a-gain ma-ny and
ma-ny a time; and just when we thought there was not
a bit of chub-by child to be seen, a round red laugh-ing
face would peep out, fol-lowed by a sort of wind-mill of
arms and legs.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was on a bright sum-mer’s day in that hay-field that
we met Tim and his lit-tle mis-tress. “Who was Tim?”
you say. Well, Tim was a don-key, and such a hap-py
pet-ted don-key has sel-dom been seen be-fore. Liz-zy—the
lit-tle girl you see in the pic-ture—was the far-mer’s
daugh-ter, and as she led Tim round her fa-ther’s field,
she picked up the sweet hay and fed him with it.</p>

<p class='c008'>When Tim and lit-tle Liz-zy came near us, we all went
up to pat the don-key: then the lit-tle girl told us how
good and gen-tle her Tim was. “We are very luc-ky to
have such a good don-key,” said she.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And I think he is luc-ky to have such a good lit-tle
mis-tress,” said I.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, but he be-longs to us all,” an-swered the child,
“and there are six of us; we all feed and pet him. My
father bought him when he was quite lit-tle. He is five
years old now; just the same age as my lit-tle bro-ther
Willy. So he is his Twin Bro-ther you see,” ad-ded
Liz-zy grave-ly.</p>

Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
